# T-Pumps
One of the best boba shops I have tried has been T pumps. I have tried many different boba places in So-Cal but this one definitely makes it on my top 5. They have good quality boba and many options to choose from. You can mix many flavors together to get a drink that is just right for you. In addition, the drink quality is usually consistent. This means that when the drink taste good the first time it tastes just as good the next time you go. Moving on, I would rate the boba here a solid 9/10 because the boba is soft but not to soft. The drink that I usually get is a lavender vanilla milk tea with boba. This drink was very good and I would rate it a 9/10.

#ShareTea
ShareTea is another one of my favorites. It has the best boba I have ever tried. They are the only place that I give their boba a 10/10. I have been going here for the past 5 years and it has been always been great. I would have made this my favorite boba place ever, but the consistency has gone down over this pandemic. Sometimes the drinks are good and sometimes they are not. However, this could just be because of the stress of the pandemic. Before the drinks were always top notch quality but recently they have been a hit or miss. Anyways, I have tried many things on the menue but my favorites are a Mango green milk tea with mini boba and a matcha fresh milk both with boba. On a good day, both of these drinks are a 10/10. Almost everything on the menue is good and I would definitely recommend this place.
